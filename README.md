## Architecture
I used MVVM for a more flexivel model to all challenges of this test.

## Provider + Models
I created the Provider layer to resolve all API Request and Memory Storage of Models. This abstrate all layer of JSON. The idea is possible separate in a framework all provide layer.

##TODO
- Detail Page with another models;
- UI Tests;
- More Unit Tests;
- Create error messages for the final user.
